# Customer Analysis Project

Customer analysis is a critical section of a company's business plan or marketing plan. It identifies target customers, ascertains the needs of these customers, and then specifies how the product satisfies these needs.

In this project, I try to analyse the revenue differences based on their state, region, gender, age and also the impacts of discounts. Here are the key benefits of why we should analyse the customer:

- Marketing Efficiency
- Customer Retention
- Increased Sales and Revenue
- Improved Profit Margins

## Key Objective

- Revenue per State
- Revenue based on Month of the year
- Revenue based on Age
- Quantity - Discount Percentage Correlation
- Percentage of Revenue per Region 
-  Revenue per Category per Gender
